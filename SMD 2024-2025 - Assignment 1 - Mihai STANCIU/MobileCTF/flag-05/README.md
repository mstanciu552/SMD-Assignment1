# Flag 05

## Writeup 

I decided to look through the **Base.lproj** directory, which contained 2 folders. Of these 2 folders the interesting one is **Main.storyboardc**. I looked at the 3 files in that folder using **strings** and found the fifth flag.

```sh
strings BYZ-38-t0r-view-8bC-Xf-vdC.nib | grep flag
```

The flag I found was: flag-5932744F-4810-4A6C-66FF3E115ED6.
